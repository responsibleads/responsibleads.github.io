# Data

The `products.csv` file includes unique product names found in the Internet Archive keywords.  Each product is linked to a unique `company_name`.  The `companies.csv` file contains company names linked with their twitter accounts.  Each `results.csv` row is a product that appeared in a show's keyword summaries, and the `identifier` column is the Internet Archive unique identifier for the show airing.  The `company_name` column can be used to join the csv files together.

There are also two summary CSV files available, one that sums the total advertisers by company for all time (`alltime.csv`) and one for the past 365 days (`pastyear.csv`).
